# Simple As Possible computer - 1  (SAP-1)

This is a VHDL implementation of SAP-1, as described in the book "Malvino -
Digital Computer Electronics". 

It uses behavioral modeling to create the blocks of the computer and structural
model to 

You can program the computer writing in the file ```RAM.vhd``` and simulate the
result with the provided testbench, which is the file ```sap1_tb.vhd```.

The simulations were perfomed with *ghdl*. If you are in linux be sure to have the program ghdl instaled and run
